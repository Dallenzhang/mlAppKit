Known Issues
============

If you come across a Bug or other issue please report it  in the `Github Section <https://github.com/erkandem/mlAppFlex/issues>`_
Let's keep this going until Mathworks finds a way to ***** it up.

Since this file is static any reference in the issues section on github should be checked first.
But here are some aspect which I came across:


flush the cache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you change large parts of your application in app designer, maker sure to 
clear the `mfiles` directories from the old mfiles.
This is pretty much like clearing a cache of the webserver.
