================
mlAppKit was written to enhence app development workflow.


The general idea is to bridge the gap between the highly 
customizable but intensly labourous and bugprone programmatic 
and drag and drop comfy way using App Designer.
App Desinger is going to abreviated by AD

Background
""""""""""

Mathworks Developers did a great job in creating AD. 
It was the first GUI design tool I worked with which 
obvously results in a bias towards it.
Looking at what's genrally possible to create for desktop 
apps and what's possible with AD I took a look at 
couple of points are unsatifying

* creating apps is easy peasy, combining existing applications into a single app can get very messy.
* the coding experience in AD is pretty weak and gets quite sluggish passing a system specific magic number of lines
* the structuring capabilities are to the designlevel but not to the coding level 
* code folding unavailable

As a result of  these issues the general result is an monstrous monolithic apps which comes with is:

* bug prone
* hard to read
* aglomates unneeded code
* performance is slowed down.

The other extreme is that you might have couple of 
apps which are started from one menu. This keeps every 
sub app clean but having 10 applications on your desktop 
is not the way to go.

Creating some apps for myself I realized that most of 
what I created was single use only. This is cynic since the 
rockbottom of these apps are classes which are intended 
to be reusable objects.

Trying to get more experience I used tools like:

* Android Stuido
* Visual Studio
* Java Swing
* Qt Designer
* various Pythonic ways

Qt would be my choice professional apps despite.
Obviously Android Studio is for mobile only.
Java Swing and Visual Studio could be Great things if you know Java or C++

There are many python ways of creating GUIs including Qt bindings.




How is this done?
