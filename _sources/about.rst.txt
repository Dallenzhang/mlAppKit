About 
================
mlAppKit was written to enhance app development workflow.


The general idea is to bridge the gap between the highly 
customizable but intensely laborious and bug-prone programmatic
and drag and drop comfy way using App Designer.
App Designer is going to abbreviated by AD

Background
""""""""""

Mathworks Developers did a great job in creating AD. 
It was the first GUI design tool I worked with which 
obviously results in a bias towards it.
Looking at what's generally possible to create for desktop
apps and what's possible with AD I took a look at 
couple of points are unsatisfying

* creating apps is easy-peasy, combining existing applications into a single app can get very messy.
* the coding experience in AD is pretty weak and gets quite sluggish passing a system specific magic number of lines
* the structuring capabilities cover design layer but not to the coding layer
* code folding unavailable

As a result, result are monstrous monolithic apps are:

* bug prone
* hard to read
* agglomerate useless code
* IDE performance in is slowed down with the code size

The other extreme is that you might have couple of 
apps which are started from one menu. This keeps every 
sub app clean but having ten applications on your desktop
is not the way to go.

Creating some apps for myself I realized that most of 
what I created was single use only. This is cynic since the 
rock bottom of these apps are classes which are intended
to be reusable objects.

Trying to get more experience I used tools like:

* Android Studio
* Visual Studio
* Java Swing
* Qt Designer
* various pythonic ways

Qt would be my choice professional apps despite.
Obviously Android Studio is for mobile only.
Java Swing and Visual Studio could be Great things if you know Java or C++

There are many pythonic ways of creating GUIs including Qt bindings.



How is this done?

This project is meant to be a referance. An was used developed during the core  
I would certainly enjoy developing it further. But I will need your feedback.
