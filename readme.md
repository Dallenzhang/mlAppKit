## Creating Apps ...

... usign MATLAB App Designer us  as almost as easy
as creating an Excel spreadsheet.

## maintianing
However maintianing App Designer projects can be a nightmare
Problems emerge only for more sophisticated apps since:

*  the editor starts to laaaAAAAaaaag
*  no possiblity for further code folding

## reusing
.... your created application parts is almost impossible.
Copy paste takes care of the UI Elments but that's it.
Callbacks need to be copied and adjuste manually. 
Every manual step is just one more possibility to **@!&%$** up everything.
It is more safe to create a new app than to risk night sessions of debugging.

* **Effectivly, the Aps are Single Use Apps** *
